[Siri](https://www.apple.com/in/siri/), Apple's voice assistant, can be used for a variety of tasks, from setting reminders and sending messages to playing music and searching the web. However, what if we could connect Siri to a more advanced AI system like [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt)? In this blog post, we'll explore how you can connect Siri with ChatGPT to unlock new possibilities for voice assistants.

ChatGPT is an advanced AI system that uses machine learning algorithms to understand and respond to natural language queries. With access to vast amounts of data, ChatGPT is capable of answering complex questions, providing detailed information, and generating human-like responses. By connecting Siri with ChatGPT, you can leverage the power of both systems to create a more comprehensive voice assistant experience.

To get started with connecting Siri with ChatGPT, you'll need to use a third-party app called [Shortcuts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id915249334). Shortcuts is a free app that allows you to create custom commands that trigger multiple actions across multiple apps. 

Here's how to set up Siri to work with ChatGPT using Shortcuts:

## Create ChatGPT API

To utilize ChatGPT's functionalities with Siri on your iPhone, it is essential to use its API. Accessing ChatGPT's API key requires logging in to your OpenAI account and navigating to the OpenAI API keys page. Here, you can generate a new secret key by clicking on the "Create new secret key" option, which you can use in conjunction with Siri Pro.

Head to [OpenAI APIs page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) to get the API key.

Once you get the API copy key. You can not copy API key again so it is recommanded to keep it somewhere safe.

## How to setup ChatGPT with Siri on IPhone

After downloading the Siri Pro shortcut and obtaining the API key, the next step is to activate the Siri shortcut and check it in action:

1. Launch the Shortcuts app and navigate to the downloaded Siri Pro shortcut.
2. You may find the Siri Pro shortcut there. Tap on the ellipsis button (three dots) to open the shortcutâ€™s settings.
3. In the second dialog box labeled as "Text," there will be a prompt to "Insert ChatGPT API Key here." Simply paste the API key that you had copied earlier and then click on "Done" located at the top right corner.
4. You have successfully integrated ChatGPT with Siri on your iPhone. You can now activate the shortcut either by tapping on Siri Pro in the Shortcuts app or by saying "Hey Siri" followed by the name of the shortcut.
